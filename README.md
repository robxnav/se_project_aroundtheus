**Grid Layout**

The grid layout was the most essential component of the webpage to make it responsove throughout different screen sizes across devices.

**Media Queries**

Media queries were set at 1280px, 775px, and 618px to make them easier to browse on desktops, tablets, and phones.

**Text-overflow**

Various styles were given to components to prevent text overflow from breaking the design. Styles such as text-overflow, white-space, overflow, and max-width help protecting the design and making them more flexible as different users may input different data.

**Flat BEM file structure**

BEM file structure was used to make future edits and debugging easier for the user.
